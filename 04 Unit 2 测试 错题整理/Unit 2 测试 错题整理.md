      -- I meant ++++, but when I was leaving I couldn’t find her anywhere.

      A. to do    **B. to have**    C. doing    ~~D. doing so~~

      **to mean to do sth: 打算做某事**

      "mean to do"的事件发生在**过去**"was leaving"的事件前，用**过去完成时**，完整句应为**I had meant to thank her**。 但题目将**have meant**改为了**meant**，因此将**meant**后面的时态往前推一格，即**I meant to have thanked her.** 省略thanked her即为**B. to have**。

      A. 0    B. 1    ~~C. 2~~    **D. 3**

      b) The scientist ~~has made~~ **has been making** the experiment for half a year, but he hasn’t succeeded yet. 非持续性动词需使用现在完成进行时。

      c) 正确

      d) By the time Sam came back to our rescue, most of us ~~will have been~~ **will had been** washed away by the flood. by+过去的过去完成时+will虚拟语态。
