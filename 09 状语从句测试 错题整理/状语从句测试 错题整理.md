### Section A: Multiple Choices

1. Jenny had just walked out of the classroom ++++ she heard her deskmate calling her that she had left her mobile phone on the desk.

   A. while  **B. when**  ~~C. as~~  D. since

   **when**的一种用法：**sb had done sth ... when ..."：某人刚刚做完某事，这时...

2. ++++, the more severe the winters are.

   A. The more north you go  ~~B. The farther you go the north~~  C. The more you go north  **D.  The farther north you go**

   B: The farther you go **to** the north.

   C: 意为“去北方的次数越多”，不符。

9. We can never expect a bluer sky ++++ we create a less polluted world.

   **A. until**  B. if  ~~C. unless~~  D. when

   ***我认为答案错误，应该选unless的原因：***

   1. ***can never expect用于表达逻辑关系更符合英语使用习惯。***
   2. ***尽管要先发生后句才能发生前句，但是本质上两者是一种条件关系，时间关系只是条件关系的一个表现结果。***
   3. ***until表达的是一定会发生的事件的时间，但是后句所指代的事件不一定会发生，也不代表一个具体的时间点。***
   4. ***until更多应用于not...until的否定用法，此处并不是此用法最妥当的场景。***

11. I'd like you to take my picture ++++ stands one of the tallest buildings in the world - the Jinmao tower.

    A. which  B. there **C. that**  **D. where**

    **In my picture stands one of the tallest buildings in the world** 故为 **in which / where**.

    *考察定语从句。*

27. The Apple company had scarcely released iPhone ++++ it became one of the best-selling electronic products.

    A. than  ~~B. before~~  C. while  **D. when**

    **scarcely ... when**表**一...就**的用法。

28. Which is wrong?

    A. Whatever he did is reasonable.  **B. No matter what he did is reasonable.**

    ~~C. Whatever happens, we will never give in.~~  D. No matter what happens, we will never give in.

    B. ~~No matter what~~ **Whatever** he did is reasonable.

    *考察名词性从句。*

34. He ++++ to the lab than she set out to do the experiment.

    ~~A. had hardly got~~  B. hardly got  **C. had no sooner got**  D. will no sooner get

    **no sooner ... than ...**表**一...就**的用法。

35. She must have gone out early, ++++ she had not shown up at breakfast.

    ~~A. since~~  **B. for**  C. because  D. therefore

    **for**表因果关系较为间接。since一般置于句首。

### Section B: Fill in the blanks with the correct conjunction.

4. The day must be breaking, ++~~while~~ **for**++ the birds have begun singing.

   后句为判断前句的**原因**，故填**for**。

5. John may phone tonight. I don't want to go out ++~~even if~~ **in case**++ he phones.

   考虑到John**可能**打电话我不出去，故填**in case**。

8. Scarcely had he arrived in Hong Kong ++~~than~~ **when**++ she rang me up.

   **Scarcely ... when**表**一...就...**用法。

10. ++~~As~~ **Once / Immediately / Instantly**++ they heard the shout for help, they rushed out. （一...就...）

    一...就... 用词见表格。directly不是很妥当，因为它强调**不经任何其它步骤**，但是**Immediately / Instantly**强调**时间**。

    ***我认为Once在此处所用没有任何不妥之处。***

11. You should try to get a good night's sleep ++~~for~~ **however**++ much work you have to do.

    **无论**你有**多少**工作，你要试着睡个好觉，故填**however** (much)。
